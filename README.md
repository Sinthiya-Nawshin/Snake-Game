This project contains 4 files.

1) In snake.py file, we create the snake and get it moving around.
2) In food.py file, we create a circular shaped food and put it in random places for the snake to go and get it.
3) In score.py file, we keep track of the score, and the game is over when the snake hits the walls or its own tail.
4) Lastly, in main.py file, we call all the classes and their attributes and methods to put it all together.

After downloading the project, hit run on the main.py file to play the game.

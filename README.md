The Snake Game project contains 4 files.

1) In snake.py file, we create the snake and get it moving around.
2) In food.py file, we create a circular shaped food and put it in random places for the snake to go and get it.
3) In score.py file, we keep track of the score, and the game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own tail.
4) Lastly, in main.py file, we assemble everything and it all comes together.

After downloading the project, hit run on the main.py file to play the game.
